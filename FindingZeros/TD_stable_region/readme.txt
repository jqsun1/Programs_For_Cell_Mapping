This is a simplified algorithm specially designed for scalar zero finding. Instead locating the scm attraction cells as the further refine and selection candidates, this approach takes the strip cells as the candidate set. The strip set, which forms a buffer zone between positive and negative function value, could dramatically save computational time compare with the Newton's iteration method as underlying dynamics. Since no iteration is actually conducted but only function sign identification is carried out. CPU run time is 4.35s for this TD PD example. Note this appraoch utlizes the fact that for a scalar function, a buffer zone always exists. For MIMO case, this fact doesn't stand.
